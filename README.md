This repository contains code associated with my Princeton University undergraduate senior thesis entitled "CloudMAV: Unlocking Range and Compute with Wifi Connectivity in Micro Aerial Vehicles". Much of the code is adapted from the [Bitcraze AI Deck firmware](https://github.com/bitcraze/aideck-esp-firmware/tree/main/main).

The repository also includes two demo videos in the ```results``` folder. You may need the Git Large File Storage extension to pull them locally and view them.
